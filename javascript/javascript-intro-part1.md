#Quick reference to JavaScript
Scope, Lifetime, Strict mode, Data types, ````typeof```` & Hoisting

## Is JavaScript **case sensitive**?
Yes, JavaScript is case-sensitive.
````javascript
var a = 5;
console.log(A); //Uncaught ReferenceError
````

## Is JavaScript single threaded and synchronous?
Yes, Javascript is single threaded and synchronous. JavaScript executes one command at any given time sequentially.
Web Browsers are asynchronous and they maintain an event queue. JavaScript processes the next command in the event queue after it current stack is empty!  
 

## Explain Data types
* JavaScript has one complex data type, the **Object data type** (example:date, array, regular expression, functions). 
  * Object data types are **mutable (can be changed) and they are addressed by reference. Example array** 
* JavaScript has **six simple data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol**. 
  * Simple (primitive) data types are **immutable (cannot be changed) and they are addressed by value**
  * Number is of type float by default

## Is JavaScript pass by value or reference?
  - Javascript is **always pass by value**, but when a variable refers to an object (example: arrays), the "value" is a reference to the object.
  - Changing the value of a variable never changes the underlying primitive or object
  - However, changing a property of an object referenced by a variable does change the underlying object.

```
#source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6605640/javascript-by-reference-vs-by-value
var a = ["1", "2", {foo:"bar"}];
var b = a[1]; // b is now "2";
var c = a[2]; // c now references {foo:"bar"}
a[1] = "4";   // a is now ["1", "4", {foo:"bar"}]; b still has the value
              // it had at the time of assignment
a[2] = "5";   // a is now ["1", "4", "5"]; c still has the value
              // it had at the time of assignment, i.e. a reference to
              // the object {foo:"bar"}
console.log(b, c.foo); // "2" "bar"
```

## How do you achieve block level scope?
Since ES6 block level scope is achieved by using `let` in addition to global and function level scope


## Is JavaScript loosely typed? Explain.
Yes, Javascript is a dynamic loosely typed language.
````javascript
// Dynamic - variable names can be used to refer to different data types
a = "123";
a = True;

//Loosely typed - variable type not needed explicitly
a = 1 + 2;
console.log(a); //3   JS figures out the values are number

a = "123" + 4
consolve.log(a) //1234 JS figures out the values are strings and concatenates them!
````

## Explain prototypal Inheritance?
  - JavaScript is classless and does not support classical inheritance.
  - Each object is a prototype of another object, and inherits the properties defined in the prototype
```
var dog = {legs:4};
var spot = Object.create(dog);
console.log(spot.legs);  //4
```  

## What is Coercion?
Converting a value from one type to another is often called "type casting," when done **explicitly**, 
and "coercion" when done **implicitly** (forced by the rules of how a value is used).
````javascript
var a = 10
typeof(a)  //number
var b = a + ""
console.log(b) //"10"
typeof(b) //string

````


## What are Anonymous functions?
An anonymous function is a function that was declared without a name identifier to refer to it. One common use 
for anonymous functions is as arguments to other functions. Another common use is as a closure
```
var anon = function() {
  alert('I am anonymous');
};
anon();
```


##Simple data types &amp; `typeof`
````javascript
var a = 5.001
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //number
a = "Harish"
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //string
a = ["a", "b", "c"]
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //Object
a = {name: "a"};
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //Object
a = true;
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //boolean
var a = function () {console.log("Hello World!")}
console.log (typeof a)             //function
a  = "Harish " + 5
console.log(a, "a type =", typeof a)  //Harish 5 , a type=String :boom:
````

##Scope, Lifetime &amp; Strict mode
* If you assign a value to a variable that has *not been declared*, it will **automatically become a global variable**
* Lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is **declared**.
  * Local variables are deleted when the function is completed
  * Global variables are deleted when you **close the page**
* Strict mode will trigger code execution in strict mode. Variables need to declared before using
* More examples on [Hoisting & Scope](https://github.com/harishvc/quick-references/blob/master/javascript/javascript-functions-part6.md)


##Comparison && Logical operators
* ````==```` compare by value
* ```===``` compare by value and type
* When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number
  * An empty string converts to 0
  * A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false
````javascript
var a = 5   
console.log(a==5);     //true
console.log(a=="5");   //true convert string to number  :boom:
console.log(a==="5");  //false
````

## `null` vs `undefined`
- `null` can be **manually** to a value 
- `undefined` will be the default value (Hosting)


##Bitwise Operations
````javascript
console.log(5 & 1);      //0101 & 0001 = 1  AND
console.log(5 | 1);      //0101 | 0001 = 5  OR
console.log(~5);        //~0101 = 10        NOT
console.log( 5 ^ 1);    //0101 ^ 0001 = 4   XOR
console.log( 5 >> 1);   //101 becomes 010 = 2    Right Shift
console.log( 5 << 1);   //101 becomes 1010 = 10  Left Shift 
````

##What is the  difference between `window.onload`, `document.onload` and `$(document).ready()`?
`window.onload() { }`
  -  fired after the entire page loads, including its content (images, css, scripts, etc.)
`document.onload() { }`
  - run code as soon as the Document Object Model (DOM) is loaded - faster!
 `$(document).ready()`
  - JQuery code is run as the Document Object Model (DOM) is loaded which should be faster and less prone to loading errors across different browsers.


##Asynchronous module definition (AMD) 
AMD is a JavaScript specification that defines an API for defining code modules and their dependencies so modules can be loaded asynchronously if desired.
Major benefit is **performance**  - only loading modules when needed. Interested? Check out [AMD versus CJS. Whatâ€™s the best format?](http://unscriptable.com/2011/09/30/amd-versus-cjs-whats-the-best-format/)
