#Quick reference to JavaScript
Scope, Lifetime, Strict mode, Data types, ````typeof```` & Hoisting

## Is JavaScript **case sensitive**?
Yes, JavaScript is case-sensitive.
````javascript
var a = 5;
console.log(A); //Uncaught ReferenceError
````

## Is JavaScript single threaded and synchronous?
Yes, Javascript is single threaded and synchronous. JavaScript executes one command at any given time sequentially.
Web Browsers are asynchronous and they maintain an event queue. JavaScript processes the next command in the event queue after it current stack is empty!  
 

## Explain Data types
* JavaScript has one complex data type, the **Object data type**. 
  * Object data types are **mutable (can be changed) and they are addressed by reference** 
* JavaScript has **six simple data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol**. 
  * Simple (primitive) data types are **immutable (cannot be changed) and they are addressed by value**
  * Number is of type float by default
````javascript
var x = 5
var y = x;
x = 1;
console.log(x,y); //1,5  reference by value

var people = {Name:"Harish", Height:6}
var y = people;
people.Name = "test";
console.log(people.Name,y.Name);   // test test   , reference by address
````
## How do you achieve block level scope?
Since ES6 block level scope is achieved by using `let` in addition to global and function level scope


## Is JavaScript loosely typed? Explain.
Yes, Javascript is a dynamic loosely typed language.
````javascript
// Dynamic - variable names can be used to refer to different data types
a = "123";
a = True;

//Loosely typed - variable type not needed explicitly
a = 1 + 2;
console.log(a); //3   JS figures out the values are number

a = "123" + 4
consolve.log(a) //1234 JS figures out the values are strings and concatenates them!
````

## What is Coercion?
Converting a value from one type to another is often called "type casting," when done **explicitly**, 
and "coercion" when done **implicitly** (forced by the rules of how a value is used).
````javascript
var a = 10
typeof(a)  //number
var b = a + ""
console.log(b) //"10"
typeof(b) //string

````

##Simple data types &amp; `typeof`
````javascript
var a = 5.001
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //number
a = "Harish"
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //string
a = ["a", "b", "c"]
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //Object
a = {name: "a"};
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //Object
a = true;
console.log("a type =", typeof a)  //boolean
var a = function () {console.log("Hello World!")}
console.log (typeof a)             //function
a  = "Harish " + 5
console.log(a, "a type =", typeof a)  //Harish 5 , a type=String :boom:
````

##Scope, Lifetime &amp; Strict mode
* If you assign a value to a variable that has *not been declared*, it will **automatically become a global variable**
* Lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is **declared**.
  * Local variables are deleted when the function is completed
  * Global variables are deleted when you **close the page**
* Strict mode will trigger code execution in strict mode. Variables need to declared before using
* More examples on [Hoisting & Scope](https://github.com/harishvc/quick-references/blob/master/javascript/javascript-functions-part6.md)


##Comparison && Logical operators
* ````==```` compare by value
* ```===``` compare by value and type
* When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number
  * An empty string converts to 0
  * A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false
````javascript
var a = 5   
console.log(a==5);     //true
console.log(a=="5");   //true convert string to number  :boom:
console.log(a==="5");  //false
````

##Bitwise Operations
````javascript
console.log(5 & 1);      //0101 & 0001 = 1  AND
console.log(5 | 1);      //0101 | 0001 = 5  OR
console.log(~5);        //~0101 = 10        NOT
console.log( 5 ^ 1);    //0101 ^ 0001 = 4   XOR
console.log( 5 >> 1);   //0010 = 2          Right Shift discarding bits shifted off.
console.log( 5 >>> 1);   //0010 = 2         Right Shift discarding bits shifted off and shifting in zeros from the left
console.log( 5 << 1);   //1010 = 10         Left Shift shifting in zeros from the right 
````

##Hoisting
* Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of **moving declarations to the top of the current scope**  
* Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations
````javascript
console.log("x=",x);  //undefined  , Hoisting in action!
var x;
x = 5
console.log("x=",x);  //5
console.log("x+y=",x+y); //Error: NaN (non-configurable and non-writable property)
var y=5;
````

##Asynchronous module definition (AMD) 
AMD is a JavaScript specification that defines an API for defining code modules and their dependencies so modules can be loaded asynchronously if desired.
Major benefit is **performance**  - only loading modules when needed. Interested? Check out [AMD versus CJS. Whatâ€™s the best format?](http://unscriptable.com/2011/09/30/amd-versus-cjs-whats-the-best-format/)
