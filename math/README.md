##Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
* Any integer greater than 1 is either a prime number, or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers
````
2 = Prime
3 = Prime
4 = 2 x 2
5 = Prime
6 = 2 x 3
7 = Prime
8 = 2 x 2 x 2
````
* Prime numbers are the basic building blocks of all numbers
* Product of prime numbers is unique - only one set of prime numbers can generate the product
  * Can be used as **hash key** but time complexity to find prime numbers is high!
````
15 = 3 x 5 
42 = 2 x 3 x 7
