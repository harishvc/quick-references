# WWW Quick Reference - Part I

## OSI Layer
 
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)) is **reference model** that shows how  applications communicate over a network. A reference model is a **conceptual framework** for understanding relationships. 
* Layer 7: Application layer
* Layer 6: Presenation layer. Data encryption is handled
* Layer 5: Session layer. This is the layer where connections between computers are established, managed, and torn down
* Layer 4: Transport layer. On the internet, TCP and UDP provide these services for most applications
* Layer 3: Network layer handles routing of the data. IP is the network layer for the Internet (router)
* Layer 2: The data link layer. Ethernet is the main data link layer (switch). MAC address is used in this layer.
* Layer 1: Physical Layer provides the hardware for sending and receiving data (hub)

## What is MAC address? How is it used?
 - MAC address is a **physical address**
 - Media Access Control (MAC) address is an unique identifier associated with each individual network device (wireless card, ethernet card, wireless access point)
 - MAC numbers are embedded into the hardware during the manufacturing process
 - MAC addresses is a 6 set of 2 hexadecimal values seperated by `:` 
 - 48-bits address 
 - Operates at OSI Layer 2

## What is IP address?
- **Logical address** of the network interface connected to the internet - changes when you move from one network to another!
- Operates at OSI Layer 3
- 4 sets of numbers separated by `dotted decimal`. Each set represents a 8-bit number ranging from (0-255)
- 32-bit address


## What is Class A,B,C,D,E network?
- IP address is 4 sets of 8 bits (total 32 bits = 4 bytes)
- Class A: Highest bit is set to 0, and contains 7 bits for network number & 24 bits for host number
- Class B: Highest bit is set to 10, and contains 14 bits for network number & 16 bits for host number
- Class C: Highest bit is set to 110, and contains 21 bits for network number & 8 bits for host number
- Class D: Highest bit is set to 1110 to support multicasting
- Class E: Highest bit is set to 1111 reserved for experimental use

## What is the purpose of a subnet mask?
 - A subnet mask contains four bytes (32 bits) and is often written using the same `dotted-decimal` notation as IP address
 - Applying the subnet mask to an IP address splits the address into two parts - network address, host address
 - For a subnet mask to be valid, leftmost bit must be set to `1` and right most bit must be set to `0` 
 - Subnet allows network administrators some flexibility in **defining relationships** among machines in the same network address


## What is the purpose of 127.0.0.1?
- `127.0.0.1` is the loopback IP address also referred to as the `localhost`
- Lookback address is used by the computer to communicate with itself - mainly for diagnostics and troubleshooting
- Loopback address is used by protocols such as OSPF to determine specific properties on the device
- Since loopback interface address never changes it is the preferred method for **device identification**


## What is firewall?
Firewall is part of a computer network and has set of rules designed to *block unauthorized access*

## What is a default gateway?
The default gateway that you see is a node on your network which acts as a **bridge to the outside world**. It is usually the IP address of your router.

## What is my IP address?
- On Windows issue  `cmd` to open a window and then type `ipconfig` 
- On Linux/OS X issue `ifconfig`  and look for IP address of wireless or wired device

## Explain Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)?
- The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a **supporting protocol** in the Internet protocol suite.
- Used by network devices (example: routers) to send error messages and operational information to the source. 
- Example: requested service is not available or router could not be reached

## Explain Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?
- Reference: https://www.tummy.com/articles/networking-basics-how-arp-works/
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network layer protocol used to **convert** an IP address into a physical address (MAC address)
- A lookup (ARP) table is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address
- If the IP address is not found in the ARP table, using the `ARP` protocol a **broadcast packet** sent the network asking `who has a.b.c.d`
- Any machine with the requested IP address will reply back using the `ARP` protocol `I am a.b.c.d`
- Where multiple machines have the same IP address, you may get multiple responses and one that gets placed in the ARP table can vary depending on the networking implementation!
- Display ARP in linux
```bash
$>arp -an | grep 10
? (10.0.0.199) at a:b:c:d:f on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (10.0.0.191) at (incomplete) on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
```

## Explain `ping`?
- Ping is a network diagnostic tool used to diagnose if a target device is **reachable**
- Ping works by sending an `ICMP` `Echo Request` to a specified target device and waits for a `Echo Response`
- Ping repeats (until interrupted) and displays `bytes sent`, `ttl` and `time`. In the end average `round-trip time` is calculated and displayed
- Monitor network availability, can't `ping` ports (since ports are part of Transport Layer)
```bash
$ping harishvc.com (104.31.64.151): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 104.31.64.151: icmp_seq=0 ttl=56 time=13.024 ms
64 bytes from 104.31.64.151: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=19.584 ms
64 bytes from 104.31.64.151: icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=14.492 ms
^C
--- harishvc.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 13.024/15.700/19.584/2.811 ms
```

## Explain `traceroute`?
- Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G05y9UKT69s
- `traceroute` is a network diagnostic tool used to determine ** path packets** are taking to the destination
- path includes routers, computers or any other devices
- `TTL` value is incremented until the packet reaches the destination
- Router receiving a packet with `TTL` of 1  sends back to the original sender an ICMP response "TTL exceeded" - path is determined!
- Limitations: Routers have to be configured to send `ICMP` response, network has to *allow* the `ICMP` response to come back to the original sender


## Protocols & PORT
```
HTTP:  80 ,443
DNS (named): 53
SSH: 22
SMTP: 25
```

## List all open ports currently in use?
- On Linux/OS X issue `netstat`
- Additional flags to filter by `listening sockets`, `port number`, `tcp ports`, `udp ports`

## Is a specific service running on a target machine?
- Use `nmap`
- `nmap` ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks.
- Example: Check if port 80 is open in `harishvc.com`
```bash
$>nmap -p 80 harishvc.com
...
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http
```

## What is `tcpdump`?
- `tcpdump` is a tools for gathering all network traffic on the machine
- Example: `$tcpdump -i eth0 -port 8080 -src x.x.x.x -w output_file` gathers all network traffic on interface `eth0` on port `8080` from `x.x.x.x` and saves to output file! 

## Explain `no route to host`?
- `no route to host` means that your computer canâ€™t reach the host (target) server
- Troubleshooting tips: is host running? check port, check iptables, ping by ip, ping by server name, check `/etc/hosts.allow`, `/etc/hosts.deny`  


## Explain `request timedout`?
- `request timed out` means that the host did not receive a response. 
- This error could be caused by firewall rules, routing error or packet filtering

## TCP/IP vs UPD?
TCP/IP
* TCP is connection oriented - 3 way handshake
* TCP guarantees (in-order) packet delivery
* Example: HTTP,SMTP, SSH    

UPD
* UPD is connection less
* Ideal for low latency
* Examples: `traceroute`, DNS, streaming movie, online gaming

## Explain TCP Connection Establishment
- Reference #1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol
- Reference #2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-3-way-handshake-process/

- Before a client attempts to connect with a server, the server must first bind to and listen on port - **passive open**. Once the passive open is established, a client may initiate an **active open**.
- `SYN`: The active open is performed by the client sending a `SYN` to the server. The client sets the segment **sequence number** to a random value A.
- `SYN-ACK`: server replies with  `SYN-ACK`. The acknowledgment number is set to **one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1**, Server chooses nother random number, B as the sequence number.
- `ACK`:

## What is Domain Name Service?
* DNS is the phonebook of the Internet
* In a nutshell DNS transalates URL's to IP address

## Why is DNS propagation slow?
* Entires in DNS have TTL that make take longer


## How do you change DNS? [TODO]

## How can you do a reverse lookup? [TODO]

## What is Name Based Server?
- **Name based virtual server** hosting refers to hosting multiple domains on `1` IP address
- DNS can be configured to have a `CNAME` entry that maps the name based server to the IP address
- Apache can be then configured to resolve the name based server
- Name based virtual hosting also eases the demand for scarce IP addresses

## Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
* Proxy: Website retrieves information on-behalf of someone else. Example: People is specific subnet blocked from local news. Proxy server can access news.
* Reverse Proxy: Load balancing traffic or running services on non-standard port

## What is a name based virtual server?
* Webserver is configured to host name based virtual domains
* DNS configured to resolve name name based virtual domains
```
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	harishvc.com

```

## HTTP status codes
200 - Ok  
301 - permament redirection (retains SEO juice!)  
302 - temporary redirection  
304 - not modified 
401 - Unauthorized Error - check credentials 
403 - Directory index listing not allowed    
404 - Page not found  
500 - Server Error  


## HTTP request methods
* GET     - Request data from a specific source
* PUT     - Submit data to a specific source to process
* HEAD    - Same as GET but returns headers no other content
* PUT     - uploads a specific URI
* DELETE  - delete a specific URI
* OPTIONS - Shows all the request methods HTTP supports
* CONNECT - Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel




##  What is a recommended page load time?
* Page Load Time consists of two components: 1) network and server response time and 2) browser time   
* **Server response time** is the time it takes for a server to return the initial HTML, factoring out the network time
* Under a second (on desktops) and less than 200 ms on mobile


## How can you improve the page load time?

## What is HTTP pipelining & persistence?  

### Pipelining
* HTTP pipelining is a technique in which multiple HTTP requests are sent on a single TCP connection without waiting for the corresponding responses.
* Pipelining of requests results in a dramatic improvement
* Pipelining was introduced in HTTP/1.1

### Persistence
* HTTP persistent connection, also called **HTTP keep-alive** is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection.
* Lower CPU and memory usage (because fewer connections are open simultaneously)
* Reduced latency in subsequent requests (no handshaking)
```
Connection: keep-alive
```

## HTTP headers
```
$>curl -I http://foo.com

## Why do we need SSL?
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol responsible for establishing an encrypted (secure) link between a web server and a browser

## What is a digital certificate?
* SSL digital certificates are signed by Certificate Authority (CA), after verifying identity of an applicant. 
* After verification, digital certificates are issued along with Intermediate certificate that tie back to CA root certificate

## Steps to create digital certificate?
* Create private and public keys
* Store private keys in a secure place accessible by webserver
* Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the public key
* Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA)
* CA will provide you a SSL digital certificate for your domain and intermediate certificate
* Upload the SSL digital certificate and intermediate certificate on your server and then configure your webserver
* Intermediate certificate establishes the credibility of your certificate by tying it to your CA root certificate
* SSL digital certificates are signed by Certificate Authority (CA), after verifying identity of an applicant
